# Richtax
 Web App (Data enrichment and reconciliation with Wikidata ressources)

## Starting the App on your localhost 

1. If you do not have Python installed or an earlier version, please download [Python 3.9.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3911/) as this is the version the web app was developed with. 

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you have stored the app (for example: C:/Users/alex/Documents/richtax-app) 

3. If you have Python installed and some other versions of the required moduls, I recommend creating a virtual environment. Here you can find [instructions](https://towardsdatascience.com/virtual-environments-for-absolute-beginners-what-is-it-and-how-to-create-one-examples-a48da8982d4b) on how to do this.

4. Then install the required moduls using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Run the flask app entering `py main.py` into you terminal

6. Read the documentation first and have fun trying! :)
