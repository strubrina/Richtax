# Richtax
 Web App (Data enrichment and reconciliation with Wikidata ressources)

## Starting the App on your localhost 

1. If you do not have Python installed or an earlier version, please download [Python 3.9.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3911/) as this is the version the web app was developed with. 

2. Download the code, unzip it and store it on your computer.

3. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you have stored the app (for example: C:/Users/alex/Documents/richtax-app) 

4. If you have Python installed and some other versions of the required moduls, I recommend creating a virtual environment. Here you can find [instructions](https://towardsdatascience.com/virtual-environments-for-absolute-beginners-what-is-it-and-how-to-create-one-examples-a48da8982d4b) on how to do this.

5. Then install the required moduls using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

6. Run the flask app entering `py main.py` into you terminal

7. Read the documentation first and have fun trying! :)
